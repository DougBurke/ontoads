title: ADS Base Ontology

So this is the first try at the ADS base ontology. You can view the
[Owl File](view-source:http://github.com/rahuldave/ontoads/raw/master/owl/ADS-Base.owl).

This is very preliminary work, with no facet restrictions or cardinality yet. The facets all need a bit of tightening, and all documentation is in comments.

The idea is to capture the base astronomy research process. All ADS object, bib,
and observation ontologies will be built on this. As such the idea would be that
future classes such as `Dataset` and `Observation` and `Paper` can be the domain
of ObjectProperties in this ontology with the range some of the Classes in this
ontology.

This ontology is based off the SWAN agents ontology. Please pay particular attention to both the new terms added to model the grant and observation process
and how the SWAN ontology allows both ADS and
other organizations to curate data (see `curated_by` and related object properties).

You can see the Ontology Browser representation of the ontology [here](http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/browser/ontologies/?session=1279987203d-23612-12799882fde). This
is a much better representation than the OWL file.
