title: ADS Base Ontology

So this is the first try at the ADS base ontology. You can view the
[Owl File](view-source:http://github.com/rahuldave/ontoads/raw/master/owl/ADS-Base.owl).

This is very preliminary work.. The facets all need a bit of tightening, and all documentation is in comments. Specifically choices need to be made between subclassing and using equivalent classes in objectproperty restrictions. OWL-DL compatability also needs to be worked on.

The idea is to capture the base astronomy research process. All ADS object, bib,
and observation ontologies will be built on this. As such the idea would be that
future classes such as `Dataset` and `Observation` and `Paper` can be the domain
of ObjectProperties in this ontology with the range some of the Classes in this
ontology.

This ontology is based off the SWAN agents ontology. Please pay particular attention to both the new terms added to model the grant and observation process
and how the SWAN ontology allows both ADS and
other organizations to curate data (see `curated_by` and related object properties).

The class structure can be seen below:
