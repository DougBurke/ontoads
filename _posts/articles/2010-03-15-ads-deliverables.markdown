An OWL document needs to be delivered for each of the below. What other concepts do you think I have missed?

### ADS Base

Stuff in here must be used by more than one ontology on Biblio, Object, and Observation. This would include co-ordinate systems, units, surveys, funding agencies, collaborations, that we need to build on SWEET and FOAF. Will also include SKOS, SWAN Collections, SWAN reification. This is under construction (V0.1 end March/early April).

### ADS Biblio

ADS extensions for citing to BIBO, reification and provenance of a paper are appropriate here. Will include SKOS thesauri ontologies, SWAN PAV, BIBO, SWAN Agents. This is under construction. 2 SKOS thesauri have been converted to be SKOS-Essential OWL-DL. This effort includes identifying the appropriate SKOS subset. (V0.1 early April/ mid April)

Jay's corpus will be rewritten (April) to use these two ontologies, with other ontologies either namespaced in (where appropriate) or directly imported. (Importing is transitive).

### ADS Observation

This is untouched yet and will start with instrumentation and move to talking about observations, datasets, surveys, instruments and their connections. Who's volunteering?

### ADS Objects

This will be a thin veneer over NED and SIMBAD data models. Will need to talk about datasets (possible refactor into ADS Base). Help is welcome!
