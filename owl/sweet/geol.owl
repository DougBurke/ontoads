All crust is in the lithosphere, but lithosphere generally contains more mantle than crust. [Wikipedia]</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#Geomorphology">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Geology"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Geomorphology is the study of landforms, including their origin and evolution, and the processes that shape them. The underlying question is: Why do landscapes look the way they do? Geomorphologists seek to understand landform history and dynamics, and predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling. The discipline is practiced within geology, geodesy, geography, archaeology, and civil and environmental engineering. Early studies in geomorphology are the foundation for pedology, one of two main branches of soil science. Landforms evolve in response to a combination of natural and anthropogenic processes. The landscape is built up through tectonic uplift and volcanism. Denudation occurs by erosion and mass wasting, which produces sediment that is transported and deposited elsewhere within the landscape or off the coast. Landscapes are also lowered by subsidence, either due to tectonics or physical changes in underlying sedimentary deposits. These processes are each influenced differently by climate, ecology, and human activity.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#Tectonics">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Geology"/>
    <rdfs:comment>Tectonics is a field of study within geology concerned generally with the structures within the crust of the Earth (or other planets) and particularly with the forces and movements that have operated in a region to create these structures. Tectonics is concerned with the orogenies and tectonic development of cratons and tectonic terranes as well as the earthquake and volcanic belts which directly affect much of the global population. Tectonic studies are also important for understanding erosion patterns in geomorphology and as guides for the economic geologist searching for petroleum and metallic ores. A subfield of tectonics that deals with tectonic phenomena in the geologically recent period is called neotectonics. </rdfs:comment>
