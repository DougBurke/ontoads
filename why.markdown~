title: Why?
---

ADS's semantic web efforts stem from a desire to enable the creation of an easy 
to use, web based application using the IVOA which allows a user to perform:

* Structured Searching of Publications, Astronomical Objects, and Observations
* Faceted Browsing of Publications, Astronomical Objects, and Observations
* Creation of a Research Folders based on the above queries and browsing

The choice of a semantic substrate, in addition allows publications, objects, 
observations to participate in an infrastructure which allows one to:

* create intelligent applications which can reason and inference with the 
semantic graph
* publish resources as Linked Data, externally indexed. 
* easily aggregate metrics of interest to publishers, funding agencies, etc
* let others build applications on this substrate using SPARQL queries, 
individual resources and appropriate collections
