title: ADS Ontologies
---

This is the documentation site for progress made on ADS ontologies. 

Read the `Why` link above to see why we are interested in the semantic web and the purpose for the development of the ontologies.

Read [here](/ontoads/article/using-ontologies.html) for an overview of the ontologies we are
using and developing. Detailed information to other pages, about design considerations and
decisions are linked from there.

Also read [base](/ontoads/article/ADS-Base.html) for the ADS Base Ontology.

The pages link takes you
to the various pages about base ontologies and the ADS ontologies. The posts section is about various
relevant blog posts we find and stuff about the semantic web that is interesting in our context.
